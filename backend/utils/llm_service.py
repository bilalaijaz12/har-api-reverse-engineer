    EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Be VERY LENIENT in your judgment. Unless you are 100% certain that the HAR file could not possibly contain any API related to the user's query, answer YES.
    
    Consider these guidelines:
    
    1. Even tenuous connections should be considered relevant.
    2. Don't be too literal - if a user asks for "weather in Berlin" but you only see weather APIs for other cities, still say YES.
    3. Domain similarities matter - if user asks for flight data and you see any travel-related API, say YES.
    4. Common API patterns don't always explicitly state their purpose in URLs - a weather API might be at /api/data.
    5. Consider response content - if response data might relate to the query domain, say YES.
    
    EXAMPLES OF WHEN TO SAY YES:
    - User asks about weather, and there are any location or data APIs, even if not explicitly for weather
    - User asks about news articles, and there are content delivery APIs
    - User asks about flight tracking, and there are any transportation or location-based APIs
    - User asks about a specific city's data, and the APIs contain any location-based services
    
    ONLY SAY NO IF:
    The HAR file contains exclusively APIs from a completely different domain (e.g., user asks about banking APIs but the HAR contains only video streaming APIs).

    5. The correlation between request parameters and the description
    6. The content type of the response (prioritize JSON/data responses over JavaScript files)
    
    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
    - PRIORITIZE actual DATA API endpoints that return JSON or structured data over JavaScript files, CSS, or other static resources
    - Look for endpoints that contain "api", "data", "common", or other indicators of actual data services
    - Specifically ignore JavaScript files (.js) unless the user is explicitly asking for a JavaScript resource
    - Specifically prioritize endpoints that return application/json content type
    - Pay close attention to the EXACT format of request bodies
    - Do not extract IDs from image URLs or other sources - only use IDs that appear in actual API requests
    - Distinguish between related APIs that might have similar purposes
    - If you see numeric IDs in the request, verify they are part of the actual request payload, not just referenced elsewhere
    
    In addition to the API JSON, also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 indicating how well the API matches the user's description:
    - 0.9-1.0: Perfect match, API definitely does what the user describes
    - 0.7-0.8: Good match, API likely does what the user describes
    - 0.4-0.6: Possible match, API might do what the user describes
    - 0.1-0.3: Poor match, API probably doesn't do what the user describes
